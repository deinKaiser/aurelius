  Aurelius: A canvas where code meets philosophy, and minimalism grants freedom.

## Prologue
>       "The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it."
>
>                     — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 4:3

In the heart of Aurelius lies a realm where limitations fade and imagination reigns. It offers not just a mere structure, 
but a sanctuary where your ideas shape existence. While Express might be the familiar path, Aurelius neither binds nor constrains. 
Forge your own path, craft your own HTTP interface, or dance with what Aurelius provides (own http adapter TBD).

## Our Creed
>              “The obstacle on the path becomes the way.”
>
>                     — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 5:20

Where gaps emerge, opportunity beckons. Feel the essence of creation with every line of code; 
contribute, build, and let your unique melody resonate within the vast symphony of Aurelius.
